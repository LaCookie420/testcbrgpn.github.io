# This is a top level heading

## This is the next level

### And the next

#### How far down can we go

##### Keep going

###### You can't really call this a heading anymore

We can write an ordinary paragraph *with* **some** `interesting` ~~formatting~~. 

```
We can write a code block
```

Or one with syntax highlighting

```.py
def some_func():
    print("woo")
```

We can add an image

![Something](/static/img/placeholder.jpg "Hover text!")

And | a | table
----|---|------
with|stuff|in it
